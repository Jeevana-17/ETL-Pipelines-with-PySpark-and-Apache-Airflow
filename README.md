## Exploring ETL-Pipelines-with-PySpark-and-Apache-Airflow
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes are at the heart of data engineering. With increasing data volume and complexity, traditional ETL tools often struggle to keep up. This is where PySpark and Apache Airflow come into play. In this blog, we'll explore how to build and optimize ETL workflows using PySpark and Apache Airflow to process large-scale data efficiently.

## Why PySpark and Apache Airflow?

PySpark:

-Distributed processing with Apache Spark

-Optimized for large-scale data transformation

-Built-in support for machine learning and streaming analytics

Apache Airflow:

-Workflow orchestration and scheduling

-Dependency management between tasks

-Monitoring and logging of ETL jobs
